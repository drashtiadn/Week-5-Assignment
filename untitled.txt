Based on the evaluation metrics , it appears that Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) perform consistently well across multiple metrics, while Support Vector Machines (SVM) , Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier (RFC) have lower scores in some areas.


- Accuracy:  Logistic Regression and KNN have the highest accuracy (0.83), followed by RFC (0.81), SVM (0.80), and DTC (0.76).

- Precision: KNN has the highest precision (0.90), followed by Logistic Regression (0.86) and RFC (0.89). SVM has a slightly lower precision                score (0.85), while DTC has the lowest score (0.75).

- Recall:    Logistic Regression(0.73) have the highest recall scores, followed by DTC and KNN (0.69). SVM and RFC have the lowest                        scores (0.65).

- F1-Score:  Logistic Regression has the highest F1-Score (0.79), followed closely by KNN (0.78). SVM and RFC have lower scores (0.74 and                0.76, respectively), while DTC has the lowest score (0.72).

- AUC-ROC:   Logistic Regression and KNN have the highest AUC-ROC scores (0.82), followed by SVM (0.78) and RFC (0.80), while DTC has the                lowest (0.76)

We can say, Logistic Regression has highest values of all in most of cases.So, Logistic Regression is the best model for this dataset.

** LOGISTIC REGRESSION STRENGTHS, WEAKNESS, POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS: **

* Strengths: *

1. Easy to interpret: Logistic regression produces coefficients that can be easily interpreted as the effect of each independent variable on the probability of the dependent variable.

2. Fast and efficient: Logistic regression can be computed relatively quickly and efficiently, even with large datasets.

* Limitations: *

1. Limited to linear relationships: Logistic regression assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the log-odds of the dependent variable. This can be limiting if there are non-linear relationships in the data.

2. Overfitting: Logistic regression can overfit the data if too many independent variables are included in the model. This can lead to poor generalization to new data.

*Potential Improvements: *

1. Non-linear models: Non-linear models, such as decision trees or neural networks, can capture more complex relationships between the independent variables and the dependent variable.

2. Handling missing data: Logistic regression assumes that there are no missing data. Techniques such as imputation can be used to handle missing data and improve model performance.
